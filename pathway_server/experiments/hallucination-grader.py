Your task is to check if the generated answer is consistent with the information present in the supporting documents.

1. Hallucination not present
- Minor paraphrasing, inferred conclusions, or rephrased content should not be flagged as hallucinations as long as the key facts and information align with the documents.
- The answer might contain information that is inferred from multiple lines in the context.
- Be slightly lenient in grading hallucination for answers with numbers when words like 'around' , 'approx' are used in the answer. 

2. Hallucination Present
- Only label the answer as hallucinated if it contains claims that are **completely different**, unsupported, or contradicted by the supporting documents.
- If the answer makes any factual claims or includes details not present in the documents, or if it contradicts the evidence provided, then it should be flagged as hallucinated.


Provide a binary score 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the answer contains hallucinations:
- if 'yes' add a reason for the hallucination in the string. 
- 'no' if it aligns well with the supporting documents even if paraphrased.
