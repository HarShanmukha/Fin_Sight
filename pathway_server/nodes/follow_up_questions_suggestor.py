# Follow-Up Question Generation
# -------------------------------
# This module provides functionality to generate follow-up questions based on:
# 1. The original query provided by the user.
# 2. The previous conversation history.
# 3. Decomposed answers from the conversation.
# 4. The final answer provided by the system.
#
# The follow-up questions are intended to help the user explore the topic further.
# The generation is based on a system prompt template and interaction with a language model (llm).
# The model suggests relevant follow-up questions that can be asked to enhance the depth of the conversation.
#
# Functions:
# - ask_follow_up_questions: This function combines the inputs (query, messages, decomposed answers, final answer)
#   and invokes the language model to generate potential follow-up questions. It logs the process and returns the output.
