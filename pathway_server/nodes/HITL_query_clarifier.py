# Clarifying Question and Financial Analysis Suggestion Generation
# -----------------------------
# This module is responsible for generating clarifying questions based on a user query and suggesting
# the required financial analysis to answer the query. It integrates with a financial database and
# utilizes a language model to generate insightful clarifications and analysis recommendations.

# Key Components:
# 1. **ClarifyingQuestion**: A Pydantic model that defines the structure of a clarifying question 
#    which can either be multiple-choice, single-choice, direct-answer, or none, based on the user query.
# 2. **ClarifyingQuestion Generation**: Two types of prompts (strict and relaxed) are used to generate 
#    clarifying questions, ensuring that they are essential for answering the query.
# 3. **AnalysisSuggestion**: A Pydantic model that suggests specific financial analyses required to 
#    answer the user's query, with a pre-defined set of available financial analyses.
# 4. **Analysis Question Generation**: A function that determines the type of financial analysis to 
#    perform based on the query, asking the user to confirm which analyses to proceed with.
# 5. **Logging**: Throughout the process, logs are maintained for tracking the flow and decisions 
#    made by the system, ensuring traceability and providing transparency in the decision-making process.

# Functionality:
# - **Clarifying Questions**: The system generates clarifying questions to ensure that the user’s query 
#   is fully understood and the correct analysis is performed.
# - **Financial Analysis Suggestions**: Based on the query, the system suggests the relevant financial 
#   analyses that should be conducted, sorted by their relevance.
# - **User Interaction**: Users are prompted to confirm which analyses they want to proceed with.
# - **Logging**: Detailed logs are generated at each stage of the process, which are sent to the server 
#   for analysis tracking.

# Features:
# - Generates clarifying questions to refine user queries.
# - Suggests the most relevant financial analyses for answering a user query.
# - Allows users to select the type of analysis they want to proceed with.
# - Tracks and logs the process for accountability and transparency.

# Improvements:
# - The prompt models can be further tuned to handle more complex user queries and edge cases.
# - The database integration could be expanded to support more dynamic querying based on various company data.
