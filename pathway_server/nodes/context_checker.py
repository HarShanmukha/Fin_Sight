Context Checker Module for Conversational History Refinement

This module defines the logic for determining if prior conversational context is necessary to answer a user's query.
It integrates with a LangChain-based LLM system to analyze the user's input and decide whether prior conversation history
can provide additional context that would improve the quality or clarity of the response.

### Key Components:

1. **ContextCheckerDecision**:
   - A Pydantic model that holds the decision on whether conversational context is required. 
   - The decision is made based on the user query and previous conversation history.

2. **System Prompt**:
   - The `_system_prompt_context_checker` string provides a system-level prompt that helps the LLM decide if context from prior messages is required for the current query.

3. **Main Functionality - `check_context`**:
   - This function:
     - Analyzes the current state to decide if context from the conversation history should be included in generating a response.
     - Loads prior conversation history from a `.jsonl` file if no messages are available in the current session.
     - Constructs a prompt to check if prior conversation history is needed.
     - Uses the LangChain model to get the decision on whether the context is necessary.
     - Returns a dictionary containing the result (`context_required`) and the available conversation messages.

4. **Conversation History**:
   - The module attempts to load conversation history from a file located at `data_convo/conversation_history.jsonl`.
   - If the file exists, it loads the last recorded conversation for the current user, allowing the system to consider prior interactions.
   - The function also checks if there are no messages in the current session, and in such cases, attempts to load the conversation history for context.

5. **Logging and Decision Making**:
   - The module logs significant steps such as whether prior conversation history was used or not.
   - The decision on whether context is required is logged and returned in a structured format.

6. **Potential Use Cases**:
   - This system is particularly useful for conversational agents that need to remember past interactions or consider the history of a user’s conversation to refine responses.
   - The module can be incorporated into chat-based systems where context can enhance the relevance and accuracy of responses.

### Usage:
- This module is invoked as part of a larger conversational AI pipeline. It helps the system determine if the user's query requires additional context or if it can be answered directly based on the current input.
- The function `check_context` returns a boolean decision about whether context is required, which can then influence subsequent actions or responses in the system.

### Dependencies:
- **LangChain**: Used for interacting with the LLM for decision-making tasks.
- **Pydantic**: Used to define the structure of the context decision.
- **JSONLines**: For reading and storing conversation history.
- **Utils**: For logging and other helper functions.
- **Config**: Contains configuration settings such as the number of messages to consider for context and logging settings.

### Example Workflow:
1. The system receives a user query.
2. It checks if there are any previous messages in the current conversation.
3. If no messages are present, it attempts to load prior conversation history from a `.jsonl` file.
4. The system then constructs a prompt to decide if the current query can be answered directly or if prior context is required.
5. The result (True/False) is returned, indicating whether context is required.

### Logging:
- The module includes logging for key events such as:
  - Whether prior conversation history is loaded.
  - The decision on whether context is required for the current query.
  - Integration with logging and server systems to track decision-making in the pipeline.
