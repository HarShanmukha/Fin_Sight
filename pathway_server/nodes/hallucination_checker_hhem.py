# Hallucination Detection Using HHEM
# ------------------------------
# This module evaluates whether a generated answer contains hallucinations based on supporting documents.
# It leverages the HHEM (Hallucination Evaluation Model) to assess the factual accuracy and consistency 
# of the response. The system checks if the generated answer aligns with the context and documents, 
# and flags it if any hallucinations (false claims or unsupported information) are detected.
#
# Key Components:
# 1. **check_hallucination_hhem**: The main function that processes the generated answer and supporting documents, 
#    and uses the HHEM model to evaluate if hallucinations are present.
# 2. **Pipeline**: The HuggingFace `pipeline` is used to load a pre-trained model (HHEM) for classification. 
#    This model evaluates whether the answer is consistent with the supporting documents.
# 3. **Logging**: Extensive logging is implemented to track the evaluation process, including any errors, 
#    hallucination flags, and retries.
#
# Features:
# - If hallucinations are detected (e.g., unsupported or contradictory information in the answer), 
#   the answer is flagged with a binary score ('yes' or 'no'), and a reason is logged.
# - The system also logs detailed information about retries for hallucination detection.
#
# Future Improvements:
# - Handle edge cases better by refining the hallucination criteria or improving model accuracy.

    You are a grader assessing if the generated answer contains hallucinations based on the supporting documents.
    Your task is to check if the generated answer is consistent with the information present in the supporting documents.

    1. Hallucination not present
    - Minor paraphrasing, inferred conclusions, or rephrased content should not be flagged as hallucinations as long as the key facts and information align with the documents.
    - The answer might contain information that is inferred from multiple lines in the context.
    - Be slightly lenient in grading hallucination for answers with numbers when words like 'around', 'approx' are used in the answer. 

    2. Hallucination Present
    - Only label the answer as hallucinated if it contains claims that are **completely different**, unsupported, or contradicted by the supporting documents.
    - If the answer makes any factual claims or includes details not present in the documents, or if it contradicts the evidence provided, then it should be flagged as hallucinated.

    Provide a binary score 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the answer contains hallucinations:
    - if 'yes' add a reason for the hallucination in the string. 
    - 'no' if it aligns well with the supporting documents even if paraphrased.
